/**
 *
 * Header file consists of:
 *
 * -function declarations
 *  +any names the function declaration relies on
 *
 *  For example: We pass a vector to median, so we must include <vector>.
 *
 *
 *  IMPORTANT NOTE:
 *  ----------------
 *  -Qualified name of vector (std::vector) MUST BE USED, as header files
 *  are essentially copied into the files that include them. Since we don't
 *  want to interrupt any potential "using" declarations the use might have
 *  or give them some theym might not want, we use the specific names to 
 *  avoid conflict.
 *
 *
 *  Finally, the last one is simply pre-processor stuff to make sure it's not
 *  included more than once. #ifndef directive: if not defined, don't process
 *  everything following
 *
 *
 *  Technically good practice to make pre-processor stuff 1st line, avoiding
 *  here for commenting convenience
